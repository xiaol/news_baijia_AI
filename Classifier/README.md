Document Classification in Python

A tutorial showing how to leverage a few great libraries out there -- [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) -- to not only perform document similarity queries, but document classification as well.

=====
Files
=====

    corpus -- A directory of 4 tiny text files
    .gitignore -- Files in repo for Git to ignore
    classifier.py -- The main file that does everything
    requirements.txt -- File used by pip to download dependencies

========
Download
========

All you need to do is clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/Scripted/NLP-Tutorial
    
============
Dependencies
============

In a perfect world, running "pip install -r requirements.txt" should download all the dependencies necessary to run this code. Unfortunately, Numpy and Scipy don't always play nice with pip. So try "pip install -r requirements.txt" and if that doesn't work, check out the installation instructions on the modules' sites:
[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
, [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
, [Gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)
, [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

=======
Running
=======

Easy enough:

    python classifier.py
    
The output shows the various steps of the algorithm as it works.
